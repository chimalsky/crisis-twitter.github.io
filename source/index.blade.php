    Twitter needs a Crisis-Verified System 
</h1>

<section>
    <p>
        When people are looking for news and information, 
        they turn to Twitter to find out whatâ€™s happening in the world right now. 
        This is especially true during <span class="text-red-600">crises</span>, 
        where Twitter has become the first place <span class="text-red-600">voters</span> 
        go to seek accurate information, resources, and breaking news from 
        journalists, <span class="text-red-600">leaders</span>, <span class="text-red-600">experts -- medical staff, researchers, 
        emergency managers -- </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        We understand the significance of this responsibility and our teams are building new ways for people who use Twitter to identify original sources and authentic information.
    </p>

    <p>
        With that goal in mind, today we are introducing 
        <span class="text-red-600">specific experts</span> labels for 
        <span class="text-red-600">verified experts on the frontlines of the current pandemic</span>.

        </a> Twitter used to announce US Election Labels to combat the 
        problem of misinformation during elections.
        If you toggle the switch at the top-right you'll see just how similar they are.

    <h1>
        Twitter <span class="italic">could</span> 
        become the central 
        communication hub
        that we need right now.
    </h1>

    <h2>
        The missing piece is a  
        verification system suited for 
        the current crisis. 
    </h2>

    <p>
        The generally applied
        <span class="text-blue-600">blue check mark</span>
        works during peacetime:
        it protects celebrities from being impersonated and 
        prevents the spread of most misinformation. But, right 
        now Twitter isn't being used primarily to keep up to date 
        on the latest celebrity gossip or other peacetime information. 
        Right now it's a crisis, and the information feed is too much.
    </p>

    <p>
        At a time like this communication, the ability
        for emergency personnel like doctors, to learn 
        from each other is the keystone feature. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But the signal to noise ratio must be improved. 
        There are many tweets blowing up sharing stories 
        about how some doctor did something somewhere. 
        But with so many of these 'i heard' stories going 
        around with no way to trace it back to a verified 
        source, trying to stay updated on Twitter feels 
        like drinking from a fire-hose.
    </p>

    <p>
        Implement a <strong>Crisis-Verified</strong> badge 
        so that we can know an account belongs to a Doctor in Seattle, 
        or a Paramedic in Berlin.

            There are talks about people developing a seperate 
            platform for crisis personnel to communicate. Some of 
            my friends and I were thinking the same. But once we 
            got the drawing board, and once we saw how the information 
            on Twitter was evolving, we became convinced that 
            the best solution would be one with the lowest barrier to critical mass.

        <h1>
            Twitter already is the go-to for the most recent frontline information. 
            We just need to augment the verification system so that the frontline 
            information can be put front and center against the noise.
        </h1>

        <p>
            During WW2, existing American factories were converted to manufacture 
            for the military. Right now Twitter already is a very capable factory. 
            They've been verifying accounts and supervising them. 
            They have a resilient infrastructure for enormous traffic. 
            They already have the mindshare.

        Compare the 'fake post' we wrote above and compare it to the 
        actual post, you'll see that one paragraph has no differences:

    <blockquote>
        We understand the significance of this responsibility and our teams are building new ways for people who use Twitter to identify original sources and authentic information.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The values underlying the 2018 'US Election Labels' is the same for 
        the suggested 'Crisis-Verified' labels. Twitter is prepared for this.

        If you toggle the switch at the top-right you'll see just how similar they are.

        Twitter <span class="italic">could</span> 
        become the central 
        communication hub
        that we need right now.
    </h1>

    <p>
        The missing feature is a verification system suited for 
        the current crisis. The current verifcation system  
        works during <span class="italic">peacetime</span>. 
        It protects celebrities from being impersonated and 
        prevents the spread of most misinformation. Right 
        now we need to improve the signal to noise ratio. 
        Not just for citizens who want to stay engaged with 
        what's going on without going crazy in the fire-hose 
        of information, but also the emergency personnel themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Right now ther's no way to discern why an account is verified. 
        Is it a comedian? Are they a politician? Some influential CEO? 
        How much better would it be, if we could have verified 
    </p>
